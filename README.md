# CCSLib (CCSL+)

**CCSLib (CCSL+)** is a lightweight, modular client-side scripting framework designed to enhance flexibility, simplify customization, and maintain full compatibility with existing CCS scripts.  
The project focuses on a clean architecture, straightforward integration, and user accessibility — removing unnecessary or intrusive features while improving script management and toggle handling.

## Key Features

- **Script Integration:** Add scripts directly to the `/scripts` folder; each script will automatically appear within the in-game GUI.  
- **Mod Menu Integration:** Requires Mod Menu for seamless configuration and accessibility.  
- **Smart Keybind and Toggle Support:** Automatically detects `fullToggle` or `keybind` functions, allowing users to assign or enable keybinds directly from the GUI.  
- **CCS Compatibility:** Fully compatible with existing CCS scripts, with improvements tailored for developers and advanced users.
